Challenge

Our challenge for this project was to create a an API whereby we would be able to select which beers we wanted based on specific criteria. This included, but wasn't limited to, ABV being higher than 6%, beers that were created prior to 2010, as well as beers with a PH level less than 4.



If I were to continue designing this project I would add it so that individual cards would link you to specific information about the project, as well as ensureing that each checkbox would cover functionality when each box is pressed.
